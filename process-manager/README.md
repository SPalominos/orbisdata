# Process-Manager (PM)

Process-Manager (PM) is a framework to manage multiple processing factories.

A factory is a group of processes. A factory can be locked in this case it's not possible to add to it a new process or delete one.
A factory is referenced by a String identifier.

A default locked factory called orbisgis is provided.

The main classes to implement a PM are defined in the process-manager-api module.
